# AWS Projects

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a collection of my hands-on projects and coursework focused on **AWS Cloud**, data analytics, and infrastructure services. Most of the work here is based on what Iâ€™ve learned through practical labs and assignments, covering services like **EC2**, **S3**, **EBS**, **IAM**, **Lambda**, and more.

Whether you're just starting out with cloud computing or exploring AWS for academic projects, I hope these examples give you a clearer path to follow. I'm currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics, and these projects reflect my learning journey.

Feel free to explore and learn along with me. ðŸš€


# PROJECT 1- Enhancing Budget Forecasting for the Finance Department Using AWS

## Project Description
This project focuses on improving the Finance Departmentâ€™s ability to forecast budgets by analyzing current challenges and deploying a cloud-based infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to enhance data organization, accessibility, and security while laying a foundation for more accurate financial forecasting.

---

## Objective
To analyze the existing budget forecasting process, identify issues, and build a cloud-based solution that centralizes and secures financial data. The solution uses AWS tools such as S3 and EC2 to store and manage financial records effectively.

---

## Dataset
The financial datasets prepared and structured for cloud storage include:

- **Historical Budgets** â€“ Budget records from previous years
- **Department Expenses** â€“ Spending data from various departments
- **Revenue Streams** â€“ Income sources from different operations
- **Forecast Versions** â€“ Versions of budget estimates across time
- **Operational Metrics** â€“ Metrics driving financial decisions

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Analyzed root causes of inaccurate budgeting using a Fishbone Diagram
- Designed a data lake structure using Excel
- Uploaded cleaned and organized datasets to AWS S3 with folder hierarchies and metadata tagging

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Reviewed spending and budget trends over time
- Categorized financial data by department and time period
- Identified inconsistencies between forecast versions and actual spending

### 3. Data Visualization
### 3. Data Visualization
- Created architecture and data flow diagrams (Draw.io)
![Fishbone Diagram](fishbone-diagram.jpg)
- Designed visual representations of budget gaps and forecasting delays

### 4. Team Segmentation
- Identified varying data needs among different finance teams (e.g., high-frequency users vs. periodic users)
- Developed segmentation strategies for access and usage patterns

### 5. Insights and Findings
- Legacy systems lacked scalability and proper data structure
- Data was fragmented, reducing forecasting efficiency
- AWS deployment centralized financial information and enabled lifecycle rules for cost savings

### 6. Recommendations
- Continue using AWS EC2 and S3 for scalable data processing
- Automate data refresh using AWS Lambda

## Tools and Technologies
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** â€“ EC2, S3, VPC
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Data lake structuring and cleanup
- **Draw.io** â€“ System and architecture diagrams
- **Fishbone Analysis** â€“ Root cause identification


---

## Deliverables
- Fully functional AWS cloud system for finance operations
- Excel-based data lake structure with categorized datasets
- Visual diagrams (architecture, data flow, Fishbone analysis)
- Configured AWS components: VPC, EC2 instance, S3 bucket
- Final report with insights, design decisions, and implementation steps
- Stakeholder presentation summarizing outcomes and next steps

---

## Summary
This project modernizes the Finance Departmentâ€™s operations by leveraging AWS cloud tools to improve data security, reduce manual workload, and support smarter financial decision-making. It provides a scalable, structured, and future-ready environment for budget forecasting and financial analysis.
