# AWS Projects

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a collection of my hands-on projects and coursework focused on **AWS Cloud**, data analytics, and infrastructure services. Most of the work here is based on what Iâ€™ve learned through practical labs and assignments, covering services like **EC2**, **S3**, **EBS**, **IAM**, **Lambda**, and more.

Whether you're just starting out with cloud computing or exploring AWS for academic projects, I hope these examples give you a clearer path to follow. I'm currently pursuing an MBA in Business Analytics, and these projects reflect my learning journey.

Feel free to explore and learn along with me. ðŸš€
